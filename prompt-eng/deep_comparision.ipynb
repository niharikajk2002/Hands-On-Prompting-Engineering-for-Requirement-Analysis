    "## **Deep Comparison Prompting**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Comparison Prompting is a technique where the AI model is asked to compare multiple entities, ideas, or concepts in depth to assist the user in making informed decisions. This method is ideal for analyzing similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages between various options, making it particularly useful for career decision-making, product comparison, and strategic planning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Automatic Deep Comparison Prompting (Auto-DCP)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Manually designing prompts for deep comparisons can be time-consuming and complex. **Auto-DCP** automates the process by dynamically generating comparison structures based on user queries. It helps the model evaluate and contrast multiple options with detailed, well-structured comparisons that enhance clarity and decision-making accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-DCP operates in three main stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Key Comparison Factors:** The system automatically extracts the relevant attributes or criteria from the user query for comparison (e.g., job requirements, skills, salaries, benefits).  \n",
    "2. **Generating Comparative Responses:** The model generates in-depth comparisons based on the extracted factors, offering a balanced evaluation of each option.  \n",
    "3. **Ranking and Presenting Options:** The system ranks the options or presents them in a way that helps the user understand the trade-offs, advantages, and disadvantages clearly.  \n",
