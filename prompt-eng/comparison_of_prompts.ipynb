    "## **Comparison of Prompts**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison of Prompts is a technique in prompt engineering that involves evaluating and contrasting different prompt structures or methods to determine which produces the most accurate, relevant, and effective responses for a given task. This method is useful for refining and optimizing prompt design, especially when multiple approaches are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. It allows the AI to identify and recommend the best-fit prompt based on the userâ€™s needs and the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Automatic Comparison of Prompts (Auto-COP)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Manually selecting and comparing different prompt structures can be a lengthy and error-prone process. **Auto-COP** automates the comparison of different prompts by analyzing user queries, generating multiple candidate prompts, and evaluating which structure leads to the most accurate or contextually appropriate response. This method enhances prompt optimization by streamlining the selection and refinement of prompts, ensuring better performance for complex tasks such as career counseling, content generation, and strategic planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-COP operates in two main stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating Candidate Prompts:** The system generates multiple prompt variations based on the user query, incorporating different structures or techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Contrastive Prompting, etc.).  \n",
    "2. **Evaluating and Ranking Prompts:** The AI evaluates the responses from each prompt and ranks them based on accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction. The highest-ranking prompt is selected for final use.\n"
