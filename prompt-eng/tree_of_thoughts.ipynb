    "## **Tree-of-Thought Prompting (ToT)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting extends the capabilities of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by allowing AI models to explore multiple reasoning pathways instead of following a single linear thought process. It is particularly effective for decision-making, problem-solving, and creative exploration, where evaluating multiple options is crucial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Automatic Tree-of-Thought (Auto-ToT)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Manually designing diverse and effective ToT structures can be complex and time-consuming. To address this, **Auto-ToT** automates the generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning paths, ensuring the AI explores different solutions before selecting the optimal one. This method enhances flexibility and adaptability, making it ideal for applications such as career counseling, strategic planning, and AI-driven research.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-ToT operates in three main stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating Thought Branches:** The AI produces multiple potential reasoning paths for solving a problem.  \n",
    "2. **Evaluating Each Path:** Each branch is assessed based on predefined criteria (e.g., relevance, correctness, efficiency).  \n",
    "3. **Selecting the Best Path:** The model chooses the reasoning chain that provides the most accurate or useful response.  \n",
