    "## **General Knowledge Prompting**  \n",
    "\n",
    "General Knowledge Prompting is a straightforward technique that leverages the AI model’s broad pre-trained knowledge to provide quick and informative responses across various topics. This method is particularly effective for answering factual questions, offering general career advice, and providing industry insights without requiring extensive reasoning or step-by-step breakdowns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Automatic General Knowledge Prompting (Auto-GKP)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Manually crafting prompts to extract general knowledge can be inefficient. **Auto-GKP** automates this process by using predefined query structures and retrieval-based techniques to optimize knowledge extraction. This approach ensures that responses are concise, relevant, and drawn from the model’s extensive training data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-GKP operates in two main stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Optimization:** The AI automatically restructures user queries to extract the most relevant general knowledge.  \n",
    "2. **Knowledge Retrieval:** The model pulls factual information from its pre-trained dataset to generate an informative response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of General Knowledge Prompting:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides **fast and direct** responses for common questions.  \n",
    "- Covers a **wide range of topics**, making it versatile for different use cases.  \n",
    "- Requires **minimal computational resources**, leading to quick response times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges of General Knowledge Prompting:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lacks **depth and personalization**, making it less effective for complex decision-making.  \n",
    "- Can produce **outdated or incomplete** information if not paired with real-time data sources.  \n",
    "- Struggles with **nuanced or highly specific queries** that require multi-step reasoning.  \n",
