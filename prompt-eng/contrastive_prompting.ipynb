    "## **Contrastive Prompting**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastive Prompting is a method that focuses on drawing comparisons between two or more concepts, options, or ideas to highlight the differences and similarities, thereby assisting in more informed decision-making. This technique is especially useful in tasks where a user must choose between two or more alternatives, such as career options, products, or strategic decisions. Contrastive Prompting enables the AI model to evaluate the pros and cons of different choices, providing a clear, comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Automatic Contrastive Prompting (Auto-CP)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Manually designing contrastive prompts can be inefficient, especially when the task involves evaluating numerous options or ideas. **Auto-CP** automates the generation of contrastive comparisons by dynamically constructing prompts that focus on direct and structured contrasts between choices. This ensures that the AI delivers balanced, precise, and relevant evaluations, guiding the user towards well-informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-CP operates in two main stages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extracting Key Comparison Criteria:** The system identifies the most important attributes or features to compare, such as skills required, salary expectations, job growth, etc.  \n",
    "2. **Generating Structured Contrastive Responses:** The model generates side-by-side evaluations of the choices based on the extracted criteria, helping the user understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of each option.\n",
