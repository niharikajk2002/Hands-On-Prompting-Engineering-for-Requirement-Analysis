# Research Question 

I'm excited to explore how we can build an AI-powered career counseling assistant that provides personalized, step-by-step guidance, compares career paths, and empowers users to make informed career decisions! 

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

AI-powered career counseling assistants have emerged as innovative tools to guide individuals in their career decisions. These systems leverage various AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data-driven analytics to provide tailored advice. Current solutions often focus on skills assessment, job market trends, resume analysis, and recommending career paths based on user inputs. Techniques like Chain of Thought (COT) and Prompt Chaining improve reasoning and user engagement by breaking down complex decisions into manageable steps. Contrastive Prompting and Few-Shot Prompting help compare career options and provide accurate advice with minimal examples. However, challenges remain in ensuring context-aware, unbiased recommendations and integrating real-time job market data for the most relevant guidance.
